# Wardrobe-share [WIP]

I made a prototype of a platform to create and share wardrobes. Traditional online stores are great for buying individual items, but there is not much to help shoppers build a cohesive wardrobe. Wardrobe Share allows shoppers to purchase sets of items which have been thoughtfully put together by others.

There are two types of potential users - creators and shoppers
Creators:

- Fashion vloggers who want to share their shopping hauls
- Brands that want to market their collections

Buyers:

- Busy working individuals who want a fashionable wardrobe without spending hours researching and curating their own
- Individuals who want a well designed wardrobe that falls within a certain budget

I focused on the page to create wardrobes. You can check out the prototype of the page to here: https://app.netlify.com/sites/awesome-meninsky-a0f113/overview

## Design Choices

### Scrolling behaviour

Selected Items disappear when scrolling

I decided to always display selected items on the right. This makes it easier for users to compare items and it also helps them keep in mind details such as quantity of items and budget. Furthermore, it's more clear that an item has been selected as you can see the list scrolls to the item and the item counter increases.
